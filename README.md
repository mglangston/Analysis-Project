# Analysis-Project
End to end analysis on seasonal library usage | Python | Pandas | NumPy | Independent Samples t-testing

The purpose of this analysis is to explore how the seasons and time of year impact how much people read. Are there certain time of the year that people tend to read more? This analysis will be valuable for retailers, libraries and publishers. Retailers can get ahead of inventory and make merchandising decisions. Libraries can get ahead of checkout demand. Publishers will know the most effective time of year to release new titles.
